# Android P Fonts & Emojis
I made a compilation of the new Google Sans fonts from the new Android P Developer Preview 3 and came up with this module which can be flashed with other devices on Nougat and above.

## Information
I've decided to make this module to allow other devices to use the latest fonts and emojis from the newest Developer Preview instead of waiting for updates.

## Features
* Updated Google Sans fonts
* Include latest Emojis

## Compatibility
- Xiaomi Mi A1

Provide feedback via the XDA thread by inputting your phone model, current ROM. Feel free to report if it works on other devices as well. It should work on other devices as long as they are close to stock (Stock/Custom ROMs).

## Changelog
### v1.0 - 2.5.2018
* Initial release

## Source Code
* Module [GitHub](https://github.com/joeyhuab/Android-P-Fonts-Emojis)
